## About the Project

<b>NEWVolunteer</b> is a Telegram Bot that faciliates volunteering, especially amongst university students in Singapore, by promoting disucssion and easier searching of volunteering opportunities. 

Users of the bot can expect to:

1. Find volunteering opportunities based on his own criteria (frequency, location etc.)
2. Find like-minded friends to volunteer together
3. Share volunteering opportunities with others

## Motivation

Through simple qualitative research, we found that many Singaporeans are interested in volunteering, but many are not able to find opportunities that fit into their preferences. This is especially so for university students as they have limited time between their studies and activities. While websites like Giving.sg provide a list of upcoming volunteering events, the content is run and updated by the organisation itself, and is limited to the beneficiaries that Giving.sg work with. We found a lack of space for volunteers to share opportunities with other volunteers in a neat and efficient way.

## Features

- Easier

The NEWVolunteer bot is run on Telegram, and users can easily begin their volunteering journey by simple starting the bot and typing /start. As most university students use Telegram as a day-to-day communication tool with their peers, they would already be familiar with the Telegram interface and have no issue diving into the bot.

- Widespread

The bot encourages social interaction through the use of Telegram channels to direct users to recommend volunteering opportunities for their peers based on their criteria. Through the messaging app, users can also easily forward the volunteering opportunities to their friends, increasing exposure and participation.

- More Beneficial

Users are able to select from varioius criteria (location, beneficiary, timing and frequency, volunteering with friends/alone etc.). Other users are then able to recommend a more relevant opportunity and create a better potential match between volunteer and beneficiary. Volunteers are now able to give back to society, and help out the beneficiary that they are truly passionate about.
